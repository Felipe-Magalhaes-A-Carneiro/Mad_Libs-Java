# Mad_Libs-Java
In this project, I use Java to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange). This project was made for a course on the CodeCademy website.

Must print: 

"This morning Batman woke up feeling strong. It is goind to be a long day! Outside, 
a bunch of batarangs were protesting to keep weapon in stores. They began to fight to the rhythm of the money, 
which made all the bandits very dark. Concerned, Batman texted Joker, who flew Batman to Gothan City and dropped Batman in a puddle of froxen justice. 
Batman woke up in the year 9999, in a world where batmobiles ruled the word."
